# ðŸ§µ AssemblyScript Stylus

**Stylus-AS** is a work-in-progress framework for developing Arbitrum Stylus smart contracts using **AssemblyScript**. It provides a TypeScript-friendly SDK and CLI toolchain that allows developers to write, compile, and deploy Stylus-compatible WebAssembly contractsâ€”without relying on Rust.

## ðŸ“¦ Packages

- `docs` â€“ Project documentation and deliverable reports detailing technical decisions and implementation progress.
- `poc` â€“ Proof-of-concept codebase and low-level testing to validate the feasibility and scope of AssemblyScript + Stylus integration.
- `as-stylus` â€“ Core SDK that defines the contract authoring model. Includes typed bindings, decorators (`@entry`, `@view`), and safe abstractions for Stylus VM interaction.
- `as-stylus-interface` â€“ CLI to scaffold projects, compile AssemblyScript to Stylus-compatible WASM, and integrate with `cargo stylus` for validation and deployment.

## ðŸš§ Project Status

Currently in the **feasibility and prototyping phase**, with a focus on:
- Verifying that AssemblyScript can generate valid Stylus-compatible WASM
- Automating entrypoint generation and ABI-based function dispatch
- Supporting the full `cargo stylus` pipeline: `check`, `deploy`, and future enhancements

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Lower the barrier to entry for Stylus smart contract development by leveraging the TypeScript ecosystem
- Eliminate boilerplate through autogenerated contract wrappers and dynamic dispatch logic
- Provide a high-DX developer workflow with tooling aligned to familiar JS/TS patterns
